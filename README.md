## Introduction
The NJC Reader is a full stack web app that is an evolution of the NJC GP News Feed. This web app represents an improvement on earlier iterations in the following ways:  
- Cleaner back end code, adopting a *sort-of* microservices/hex-arch architecture. It is *sort-of*, as I have merely watched various Youtube tutorials on these topics and attempted to implement the principles to the best of my understanding
- Adopting Svelte/SvelteKit for the front end for a PWA experience for users
- Utilizing an actual database and the capabilities that such platforms provide, instead of Google Sheets
